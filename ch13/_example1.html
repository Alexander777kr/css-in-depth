    <h1>The Dog and the Shadow</h1>
    <p>It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was
    carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way
    home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.  As he
    crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the
    water beneath.</p>
    <p>Thinking it was another dog with another piece of
    meat, he made up his mind to have that also.  So he made a snap at
    the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of
    meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.</p>
    <p>Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</p>
